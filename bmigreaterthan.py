# height and weight are available as a regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
np_height_m = np.array(height) * 0.0254
np_weight_kg = np.array(weight) * 0.453592
bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m ** 2

# Create the light array
light=bmi<21

# Print out light
print(light)

# Print out BMIs of all baseball players whose BMI is below 21
print(bmi[light])  #get a list of bmi boolean which ,index is true if geater than 21 otherwise false..






#numpy not get the list of different type..as mixture of bool and integer...then you go through the concept of panda....
